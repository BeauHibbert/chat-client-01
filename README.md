# Class 14, Chat Client

Created by Beau Hibbert and Ben Choe

## Requirements
Your application must employ the following programming concepts:

A “hub” server that moderates all events
Multiple “clients” that connect to the hub which can both publish and subscribe to events
Must operate over a network

This project we created a chat app that uses a client and a server hosted over heroku and netlify.

This client works by making requests to the server using socket.io.
